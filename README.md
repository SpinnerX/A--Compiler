# A--Compiler
Developing my own compiler for experiementing with compiler design


### Tokenizer (Some Information)
* Job is to read tokens one at a time from input stream, passing tokens to the parser.

### Parser
* Job for parser is parsing the input tokens if they are inputted as an expression.

### Compiling Usage
* File extension is going to be `main.acc` \
* When compiling with a++ it'll be: `a++ main.acc`

### Language Usage
* printing `print "Hello World"`
* Variables `int x = 10`
* Classes `class Point{ def Point(){} }; `


### Iterations
* Tokenization (Lexer) -> Parser(Analyzer) -> AST
